# Reference Architecture

This directory contains concrete reference architectures that demonstrate
how the principles of Uncertainty Architecture can be applied in real systems.

These architectures are examples, not prescriptions.
They show how to separate deterministic control logic
from probabilistic judgment components in production.

Indranet is one implementation of these patterns,
not the standard itself.
