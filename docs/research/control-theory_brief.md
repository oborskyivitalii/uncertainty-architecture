# Control Theory Brief

Purpose:
Summarize how classical control theory concepts map to AI-integrated software systems.

Focus areas:
- Open-loop vs closed-loop systems
- Error signals in non-deterministic systems
- Sensors, actuators, and controllers
- Stability, drift, and correction mechanisms

Deliverables:
- Key concepts relevant to LLM-based systems
- Practical implications for system design
- References to patterns used in this repository
