# Reference Implementations Brief

Purpose:
Survey real-world and internal reference implementations that successfully
separate deterministic control from probabilistic judgment.

Focus areas:
- Production AI system architectures
- Containment strategies for LLM behavior
- Workflow orchestration patterns
- Failure modes observed in practice

Deliverables:
- Common architectural patterns
- Lessons learned
- Mapping to Uncertainty Architecture components
