# Core Doctrine & Theory


This directory contains the conceptual and doctrinal core of the project.

Here we define:
- What LLM-based systems are operationally
- Why AI systems are open, non-deterministic systems
- Why judgment cannot be reduced to code
- Why metrics alone cannot provide control
- Why interfaces matter more than models

This is the shared mental model that keeps the system honest.
