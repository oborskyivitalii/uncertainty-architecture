This glossary defines terms as they are used within Uncertainty Architecture.
Some terms are intentionally redefined for non-deterministic systems.

## Requirement
A requirement defines acceptable behavioral boundaries, not exact outputs.

## Bug
A bug is a systematic failure of containment or control.

## Definition of Done (DoD)
Includes observability, rollback paths, and acceptable drift.

## Definition of Ready (DoR)
Requires defined intent and known uncertainty surface.

## Judgment Node
A probabilistic decision-making component operating under deterministic control.

## Control Plane
The deterministic layer that closes the loop.
