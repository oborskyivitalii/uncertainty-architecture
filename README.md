Uncertainty Architecture

A conceptual framework for structuring, evaluating and governing AI systems under uncertainty.
Status: Early-stage, work-in-progress. Repository currently serves as a placeholder pending partner validation.

⸻

Overview

Uncertainty Architecture is a high-level model for designing and operating AI systems where outcomes are non-deterministic or probabilistic. The framework introduces a structured way to reason about uncertainty across development, evaluation, deployment and governance layers.

It builds on the idea of an AI Control Plane — a management and orchestration layer responsible for coordination, policy enforcement, evaluation loops and risk-aware decision flows in LLM-based and agentic systems. Together, these concepts aim to provide a more stable foundation for building reliable AI applications in environments where uncertainty is intrinsic to system behavior.

This repository collects conceptual materials, outlines and reference structures that will be expanded after industry partner validation.

Philosophy & Background

Uncertainty Architecture grows from a broader reflection on how modern intelligent systems reshape the conditions of software engineering itself.
The ideas behind this framework are explored in the essay:

“The Future, the Mirror and the Book” — Vitalii Oborskyi

- https://medium.com/towards-artificial-intelligence/the-future-the-mirror-and-the-book-0085eb181cfa
	
The essay describes the silent shift from deterministic software to systems built on probabilistic reasoning, the emergence of technogenic uncertainty as a new normal, and the role of institutions, governance and human judgment in navigating this transition. It provides the philosophical foundation for why a framework like Uncertainty Architecture — together with an AI Control Plane — is needed at this stage of technological evolution.

“We are building what we cannot fully predict —
and our practices must evolve before our systems outgrow our ability to guide them.

Goals
- Provide a structured conceptual model for handling uncertainty in AI systems.
- Define the relationship between the AI Control Plane and uncertainty-aware architectural layers.
- Establish terminology and diagrams that help engineering, product and delivery teams build more predictable LLM/AI features.
- Serve as the basis for a future public specification.

⸻

Non-Goals
- This repository does not contain implementation code.
- It is not an operational framework, SDK or library.
- Final structures will be published only after partner validation.

⸻

Current Status

Initial placeholder repository.
Full documentation, diagrams, evaluation loops, control-plane components and governance structures will be released in stages.

Call for Partners
We are currently moving from concept to pilot phase. If you are an engineering leader looking to implement this operational model in a real-world environment, please connect: https://www.linkedin.com/in/vitaliioborskyi/ .
