# The AI Delivery Lifecycle
While the **Architecture Diagram** shows _what_ we are building, this **Process Diagram** shows _how_ the team works. It defines the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) for probabilistic software.

### Phase 1: Discovery (The Playground)

- **Goal:** Find a prompt that works "well enough" for a prototype.
- **Action:** Manual iteration. The Prompt Steward tweaks instructions and runs ad-hoc tests.
- **Exit Criteria:** The "Vibe Check" passes (subjective approval).

### Phase 2: Engineering (The Hardening)

- **Goal:** Convert "vibes" into engineering artifacts.
- **Action:**
    1. **Golden Set:** We define 20–50 input/output pairs that represent "Truth."
    2. **Schema:** We define the strict JSON structure the model must return.
    3. **Commit:** The prompt is saved to the Registry (Git), not left in a playground.

### Phase 3: Evaluation (The Gate)

- **Goal:** Prevent regression.
- **Action:** CI/CD pipeline runs the new prompt against the Golden Set.
- **The Gate:**
    - **Fail (❌):** Accuracy < 90% or Schema breaks. The deployment is blocked. Back to Phase 1.
    - **Pass (✅):** Metrics meet the SLA. Proceed to deploy.

### Phase 4: Production (The Loop)

- **Goal:** Maintain reliability over time.
- **Action:** The system runs in the wild.
- **Feedback:** If **Drift** is detected (e.g., a model update degrades performance), an alert triggers a new cycle starting at Phase 1.
